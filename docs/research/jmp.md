## Urban Labor Supply Responses to Rural Drought Shocks: Uber in Uganda

???+ abstract
    Rural-urban linkages have long been a topic of study in the developing world. Remittances
    are often a key driver of these linkages and can act as insurance against rural weather shock risk,
    in the absence of availability and access to formal insurance products. The emergence of new
    technologies, such as gig economy platforms and mobile money, can be potentially transformative
    at allowing remittance flows to adjust more quickly to adverse shocks. I use a dataset of Uber
    driver labor supply and a rich dataset of weather indicators to estimate the effect of adverse
    weather shocks in rural areas on Uber drivers in Kampala, Uganda. Since I do not have explicit
    information on migrant status and rural connection, I leverage an external dataset of Ugandan
    voter registration and train a gradient boosting classifier on Ugandan surnames to predict which
    regions drivers are connected to. I develop a switching regression estimator to address the
    misclassification bias from the predictions. I find that a one standard deviation increase in the
    intensity of agricultural drought leads to an increase of 5.1 hours online in the month of the
    event (a 6% increase over average hours), providing suggestive evidence that Uberâ€™s flexibility is
    used to buffer against adverse weather shocks
