### Urban Labor Supply Responses to Weather Shocks for Ugandan Uber Drivers

??? abstract
    Rural-urban linkages have long been a topic of study in the developing world. Remit- tances are often a key driver of these linkages and can act as insurance against rural weather shock risk, in the absence of availability and access to formal insurance products. The emergence of new technologies, such as ride-share and mobile money platforms can be potentially transformative in allowing remittance flows to adjust more quickly to ad- verse shocks. I use a dataset of Uber driver labor supply and a rich dataset of weather indicators to estimate the effect of adverse weather shocks in rural areas on Uber drivers in Kampala, Uganda. Since I do not have explicit information on migrant status and rural connection, I leverage an external dataset of Ugandan voter registration and train a gradient boosting classifier on Ugandan surnames to predict drivers’ regions of ori- gin. I develop a switching regression estimator with exogenous switching probabilities to address the misclassification bias from the predictions. I find that a one standard deviation increase in the intensity of an agricultural shock, measured as a reduction in biomass growth, is associated with an increase of around 7 hours online in the same week, which amounts to a 20% over average hours, and then a precipitous decline in the week after. The same dynamics occur for earnings. I find that this behavior might be due to extensive margin effects driven by drivers leaving the platform for short periods. Dynamics change with whether the shock happens during the planting season of crops or not.

### A Group Random Coefficient Approach to Modeling Heterogeneous Returns to Technology Adoption

*With Emilia Tjernstrom, Dalia Ghanem, Oscar Barriga Cabanillas, Travis J. Lybbert, and Jeffrey D. Michler*

??? abstract
    Our paper revisits the econometric model that Suri (2011) (S2011) used in her study of heterogeneous returns to agricultural technology adoption. We propose an alternative group random coefficient (GRC) estimation strategy and revisit the empirical puzzle of why relatively few sub-Saharan farmers adopt modern technologies. Drawing on recent developments in the nonparametric panel identification literature, we start with an unrestricted GRC model that nonparametrically identifies the returns to adoption under time homogeneity. We show that the parameters of the S2011 correlated random coefficient model (CRC) can be identified from a restricted version of the GRC method. Specifically, the model in S2011 implies a key restriction that we call linearity in comparative advantage (LCA). Our unrestricted GRC model can be used to detect identification concerns for key structural parameters from the CRC model. We illustrate our method using the same data set as the original study and find that the motivating empirical puzzle remains unsolved.

### Identity, Location, and Voting in Uganda

*With Samuel S. Bird*

??? abstract
    A large literature studies the effect of ethnicity on voting in developing countries. Yet empirically it is difficult to measure ethnicity at a scale necessary to disentangle the effect of ethnicity on voting from shared political goals that stem from living in the same location. This paper differentiates between the effects of a voter's ethnicity and their location on voting behavior. We estimate these effects by pairing voter registration data with election outcomes from polling stations throughout Uganda. We overcome the challenge of measuring ethnicity by using a machine learning algorithm that exploits variation in surnames across ethnic and linguistic groups. We use these ethnicity measures to estimate the effect of ethnicity on support for the incumbent president in the 2016 general election. We find that differences in voting by ethnicity are significant and vary between regions, suggesting the importance of measuring and studying ethnicity at scale.

### Evaluating a Systems Approach to Suppressive Crop Rotations in Strawberry Production

*With Rachael Goodhue, Daniel Chellemi, and Krishna Subbarao*

??? abstract
    We evaluate a new, dynamic approach to suppressive crop rotations, which incorporate flexibility in cropping decisions. This “systems” approach allows a grower to change their cropping decisions mid-rotation and plant higher value crops to address cash constraints while recognizing the effect of doing so on V. dahliae populations in the soil. A grower can plant broccoli to suppress the amount of microsclerotia ($\mu s$) of disease in the soil, or plant lettuce if they need more cash in the current period. This flexibility represents a dynamic tradeoff whose intention is for suppressive crop rotations, but more broadly, it is relevant for any multi-crop production system. These production schemes must take streams of profits into account (not just profits from each crop separately), as well as any dynamic spillovers that crops may have on each other.  We use the results of a field study to calibrate a dynamic model to investigate how much this flexibility can change grower net returns, as well as how different market conditions, specifically expected prices, and levels of vertical coordination can change growers’ rotation decisions in this systems context.

### Predicting net returns of organic and conventional strawberry following soil disinfestation with steam or steam plus additives

*With Rachael Goodhue, Mark Hoffmann and Steve A. Fennimore*

??? abstract
    Pre-plant methods for managing soil-borne pests and diseases are an important priority for
    many agricultural production systems. This study investigates   whether the application of steam
    is an economically sustainable pre-plant soil disinfestation    technique for organic and
    conventional strawberry production in California’s Central  Coast region. We analyze net
    returns ha -1 from field trials using steam and steam +     mustard seed meal (MSM) as pre-plant
    soil disinfestation treatments. ANOVA tests identify    statistically significant differences in net
    revenues by treatment and trial. Multivariate regressions   estimate the magnitude of these
    effects. Predictive polynomial models identify relationships    between net returns ha -1 and two
    treatment characteristics: maximum temperature (⁰ C) and time   at ≥ 60⁰ C (minutes). For
    organic production, net returns ha -1 are statistically     similar for the steam and steam + MSM
    treatments. For conventional production, the steam + MSM    treatment has significantly higher
    net returns ha -1 than the steam treatment. Polynomial models   outperform the sample mean for
    prediction of net returns ha -1 except for the steam + MSM  treatment in conventional
    production. Results from two of three organic models suggest    that maximum soil temperatures
    of 62-63⁰ C achieved for 41-44 minutes maximizes net returns    ha -1 and may be a basis for
    further experiments.
