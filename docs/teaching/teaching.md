## ARE 106: Econometric Theory and Applications

This course focused on teaching the basics of Econometrics, starting with a rigorous derivation of OLS and the Gauss-Markov Theorem, and then discussing causation and threats to identification. The course was taught with practicality in mind, and so students learned a programming language which could help them in whatever career direction they decided to go: python. Homework assignments were done in Jupyter notebooks, which included both code and derivation. The course was meant to teach both econometrics as well as more efficient workflows and data management.
