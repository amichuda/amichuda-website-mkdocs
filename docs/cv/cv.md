## Urban Labor Supply Responses to Rural Drought Shocks: Uber in Uganda

\small
Rural-urban linkages have long been a topic of study in the developing world. Remittances
are often a key driver of these linkages and can act as insurance against rural weather shock risk,
in the absence of availability and access to formal insurance products. The emergence of new
technologies, such as gig economy platforms and mobile money, can be potentially transformative
at allowing remittance flows to adjust more quickly to adverse shocks. I use a dataset of Uber
driver labor supply and a rich dataset of weather indicators to estimate the effect of adverse
weather shocks in rural areas on Uber drivers in Kampala, Uganda. Since I do not have explicit
information on migrant status and rural connection, I leverage an external dataset of Ugandan
voter registration and train a gradient boosting classifier on Ugandan surnames to predict which
regions drivers are connected to. I develop a switching regression estimator to address the
misclassification bias from the predictions. I find that a one standard deviation increase in the
intensity of agricultural drought leads to an increase of 5.1 hours online in the month of the
event (a 6% increase over average hours), providing suggestive evidence that Uber’s flexibility is
used to buffer against adverse weather shocks
